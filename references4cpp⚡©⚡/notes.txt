1. remeber you can use CONTINUE to break over one interation of a loop.
2. To find out how many elements an array has, you have to divide the size of the array by the size of the data type it contains:
3. STRUCTURES ==groups related variables into one place. use STRUCT {} and declare members. you can set the variables to multiple as well..
4. REFERENCES A reference variable is a "reference" to an existing variable, and it is created with the '&' operator.
5. MEMORY ADDRESS, the '&' operator can be used to COUT << &VAR. this will output where the var is stored on hardware.
6. REFERENCES and POINTERS   are important in C++, because they give you the ability to manipulate the data in the computer's memory - which can reduce the code and improve the performance.
These two features are one of the things that make C++ stand out from other programming languages, like Python and Java.

7. POINTER: a variable that stores the memory address as its value. USES THE *. EX... //string* ptr = &food;//  
8. DEFREFERENCE: basically you can use the * to not only declare a pointer, but to also get the output value.
9.You can also change the pointer's value. But note that this will also change the value of the original variable:

FUNCTIONS.......

1. VOID before declaring you function means there is no return value. otherswise speicify the data type to be returned.
2. PARAMETERS. must declare data type to pass params.
3. DEFAULT PARAMETERS: declare a  value, by using the equals sign (=) when declaring the function. it will default to that value if no params are present when funciton called.
